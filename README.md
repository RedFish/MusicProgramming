# Music Programming Project  
  
The author of this project is Richard GUERCI an Erasmus student from TELECOM Nancy, France.  
This program was realised in 2013 for "CS321 - Music Programming I" at National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  
  
This program implements some musically-interesting and musically-useful audio effect/process using techniques learned in CS321 and the Libsndfile library.
